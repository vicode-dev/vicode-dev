# 👋 Hey there, I'm Victor Libert!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate tech enthusiast currently studying at **19Campus** from the **42Network**. While you won't find many repositories here on GitHub, that's because I **self-host** most of my projects on my own **GitLab instance**! (Find the link to it on my profile 🚀)

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🖥️ I **manage servers** for personal use and small companies, covering a variety of use cases like **cloud storage, network management**, and **app hosting**.
- 🌐 I'm a big fan of **self-hosting** and running my own services, including:
  - **Nextcloud** for secure file storage and syncing
  - **Headscale** for personal mesh VPN setup
  - **Proxmox** for efficient virtualization and server management
  - **Uptime-Kuma** for monitoring and ensuring my services stay live
  - **GitLab** for hosting my code and collaborating on projects
  - **LinkStack** for personalized links management
  - **Authentik** to provide **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for all my self-hosted apps

## 👨‍💻 What I Code

- 🔧 I'm mostly experienced in **C programming**, tackling low-level system tasks and projects.
- 💻 I also write a bit of **C++**, and I'm always eager to **learn new languages** and adapt to different tech stacks quickly and efficiently!

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

I'm always diving deeper into:
- 🐍 Python (mostly Django)
- 🌐 Cloud infrastructure and automation
- 💡 New technologies to improve my self-hosted environments

## 💡 Want to Know More?

Check out my GitLab for more of my work. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything tech-related or collaborate on cool projects!
